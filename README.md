# ML-Pipeline-Script
Quick Script to start testing ML models with cleaned data. Idea is to not have to write and rewrite models from scratch and possibly keep as a personal library for future ML projects

Goals:
- Have simple and modular cleaning scripts for deleting or averaging missing data and adding dummy variables/normalization (assuming those aren't already included in the ML models themselves)
- Have a classficiation (multiclass vs. binary vs. Probability), clustering (density or segmentation), or Linear Regression (with various loss functions) options
- Have a method of ensembling (get the models to vote)
- Have visualizations for measuring model performance and tweaking
- Cross Validation metrics output and static dashboard
